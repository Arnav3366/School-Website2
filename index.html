  <p class="text-muted">Every school has a library and like every school, even my school has a wonderful library. A library is a very important part of a school as it helps students to gain and acquire knowledge.

    It is the heart and soul of a school as it provides lots of information and details that students would require.Our school has a very large library. There are plenty number of books in the library. We have a librarian who keeps a track of all the books that go in and out of the library. We have an exclusive library period, where we are allowed to go and read books.

    From small story books to large reference books, journals and magazines are all available in our library. They are all arranged in different sections, so that it becomes easy for those who search for a particular book. It helps students refer notes that they are looking for and helps in cultivating a reading habit too.</p>

  <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>School Auditorium</kbd></h4>

  <hr>
  <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize"> Was built in 1982</h5>

  <p class="text-muted">High School auditorium has spent more than six decades being host to countless school and community drama productions (and rehearsals), musical performances for all five schools, districtwide talent shows, assemblies, opening day celebrations, meetings, community events and programs, award and induction ceremonies…and the list goes on and on.

    The auditorium, in its heyday, was grand. But 63 years of wear and tear (with very few upgrades over the years) has left it in need of considerable upgrades and improvements.</p>
